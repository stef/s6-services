This syslogd emulation works on any Unix where syslog() is
implemented via a connection on the /dev/log Unix-domain socket.
It needs a Unix superserver (see s6-networking, ucspi-unix or
ucspi-ipc) and ucspilogd.
A ucspilogd process is spawned for every syslog() client. It
processes logs and sends them to stderr, i.e. the service's
logger.
